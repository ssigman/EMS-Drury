# EMS-Drury
This is an example responsive interface built with Bootstrap for desktop, tablet, and phone.  The project was presented in November 2018 to CSCI 277 - Web and Mobile Application Development at Drury University.  The intial project centers on the interface only and comprises the first committ.  Additional, features will be addeded to illustrate interface with a MongoDB database via Node.js. Following the committ trail for the Dev branch illustrate process I followed in feature development.

## Install
Clone the repo and the code from committ one will run using a browser.  Later code will require Node.js and MongoDB.  The Node.js project package should be installed to ensure all the dependencies are met.

## Credits
Code and css styles for the responsive vertical menu was adapted from [Bootstrap Sidebar Examples](https://bootsnipp.com/tags/sidebar).
